My first Rust program. 

This demonstrates use of vectors, structs, overloading math operations and using an image processing library.

I use  the Rayon crate to trivially parallelize rendering the images.


TODO

* Better color palette for Mandelbrot images
* Optimized image generation using a smarter algorithm
* Zoom function
* Output animated GIF
* Command line args for color choices and resolutions.
