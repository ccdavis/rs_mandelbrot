My first Rust program. 

This demonstrates use of arrays, structs, math operations and using an image processing library.


TODO
* Make a render() function to clean up main()
* Better use of usize type to reduce amount of casting
* Add methods to Complex to do addition,subtraction and multiplication
* Overload operators for these operations
* Better color palette for Mandelbrot images
* Optimized image generation 
* Zoom function
* Output animated GIF
* Command line args for color choices and resolutions.
